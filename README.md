# Paper to Sound: A Python-Powered Paper Piano with Fingertip Detection

Get ready to transform any piece of paper into a real-life piano with "Paper to Sound"! 
This project combines the magic of computer vision and Python to create a tangible paper piano experience. Here's what you'll embark on:

* ***Computer Vision in Action:*** Master techniques like colour segmentation and hand detection to track your fingertips precisely on the printed piano keys.
* ***Python Programming for Real-World Interaction:*** Learn how to use Python libraries like OpenCV to process video streams and translate fingertip locations into actionable commands.
* ***Music on Demand:*** Discover how to map fingertip positions on the paper piano to corresponding musical notes, allowing you to play melodies and chords directly on the paper.

## Question: How to use this project on our laptop?
The answer is simple: follow some of these steps each by each.
1. setup your web camera and print piano keyboard paper
2. Once you've printed your piano keyboard paper, move on to the next step: positioning your webcam directly above the piano paper.
3. Open it up in your trusty VsCode. Let's awaken its potential by running the get_corner_point.py script nestled within the GetCornerPoint folder. Once it springs to life, a remarkable feat awaits. With a few deft clicks, you'll guide it to identify four crucial corner points of your piano paper. This information will be meticulously preserved in a file on your local machine. When the magic is complete, press the 'ESC' button to exit the program and prepare for the next exciting step in your musical journey!
4. Run the piano.py program and be ready to unlock the musical magic within your paper piano. hover your hand over a specific key, and watch the wonder unfold - a corresponding sound will be played, transforming your paper masterpiece into a digital instrument. Each key becomes a gateway to a new melody, waiting for your touch to bring it to life!

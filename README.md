# Paper to Sound: A Python-Powered Paper Piano with Fingertip Detection

Get ready to transform any piece of paper into a real-life piano with "Paper to Sound"! 
This project combines the magic of computer vision and Python to create a tangible paper piano experience. Here's what you'll embark on:

* ***Computer Vision in Action:*** Master techniques like colour segmentation and hand detection to track your fingertips precisely on the printed piano keys.
* ***Python Programming for Real-World Interaction:*** Learn how to use Python libraries like OpenCV to process video streams and translate fingertip locations into actionable commands.
* ***Music on Demand:*** Discover how to map fingertip positions on the paper piano to corresponding musical notes, allowing you to play melodies and chords directly on the paper.
* ***Customization (Optional):*** Elevate your paper piano by incorporating features like adjustable key sizes, diverse instrument sounds, and visual feedback for key presses.
